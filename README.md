8. Make sure your code has no errors before pushing into the master branch. Else you may loose the previous version of the code once committed.

9. If you are unsure about the changes you have made and don't wanna directly commit into the master, then create your own branch and push your changes in it.

10. Try to maintain 1 branch at max. And keep your branch updated with your code at all times.
